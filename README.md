# Data Structures & Algorithms
Welcome to my **_DSA repository_**!
This repo is dedicated to systematically solving LeetCode problems for technical preparation, following multiple strategies to build strong problem‑solving skills.

**Purpose of This Repository**
The goal of this repository is to build a solid and practical understanding of DSA through consistent problem‑solving.
Each problem added here contributes to:
- Enhancing algorithmic reasoning
- Deepening knowledge of essential data structures
- Practicing common problem‑solving patterns
- Writing clear and optimized C# code
- Exploring multiple approaches when helpful

**Strategies Followed**
To maximize learning and consistency, the problems are added using different strategies, including:

**Pattern‑Based Approach:**
Solving questions based on popular coding patterns such as:
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Trees & Graphs Traversal
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Heap / Priority Queue patterns

**Topic‑Wise Learning:**
Grouping problems by:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Stacks & Queues
- Hashing
- Recursion / DFS / BFS
- DP

**Difficulty‑Based Gradation:**
🟢 Easy
🟡 Medium
🔴 Hard

**Languages & Tools:**
C# is the primary programming language for all solutions.
Solutions include:
- Clean code
- Multiple approaches (when helpful)
- Time & space complexity analysis
